        <br>My degree course revolved primarily around the environment and sustainable urban development,
        and looked into various aspects of transportation and tourism in the modern era. A third of my final
        grade was dissertation-based, for which I examined the long-term social and economic
        consequences of the 1969 border closure between Gibraltar and Spain and its lingering effects.
